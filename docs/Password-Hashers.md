# Password Hashers

## Default

This is using the php constant `PASSWORD_DEFAULT` for the encryption method. The default hash type is `bcrypt`.

See [the php documentation](http://php.net/manual/en/function.password-hash.php) for further information on bcrypt and PHP's password hashing.

The config options for this adapter are: 

 * **hashType**: Hashing algorithm to use. Valid values are those supported by `$algo` argument of `password_hash()`. Defaults to `PASSWORD_DEFAULT`
 * **hashOptions**: Associative array of options. Check the PHP manual for supported options for each hash type. Defaults to empty array.

## Legacy

This is a password hasher for applications that have migrated from CakePHP2.

## Fallback

The fallback password hasher allows you to configure multiple hashers and will check them sequentially. This allows users to login with an old hash type until their password is reset and upgraded to a new hash. Â
