# Installation

The recommended way of installing and upgrading the library is [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/). Of course you can install the library manually but we **don't** provide official help or support for any other way of installing the library.

## Via Composer

Install the library with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

Global Composer setup:
```sh
composer require phauthentic/authentication
```

With the phar version of Composer:
```sh
php composer.phar require cakephp/authentication
```

## Manual installation

Download a release [from Github](https://github.com/Phauthentic/authentication/releases) and unpack it in a location of your choice inside your application. Then set up whatever autoloader system you're using. See [the official php documentation for registering autoloaders](http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.autoload.php).

You can install the library this way, there are no technical reason you can't but we don't provide official help or support for any other way of installing the library other than Composer.
